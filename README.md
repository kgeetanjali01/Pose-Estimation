# AIPose-Estimation

Gesture-Based Screen Control with MediaPipe and Python
Explore the potential of gesture control with MediaPipe Holistic! This project is an introduction to body pose detection, facial landmark estimation, and hand pose detection using Python. With this project, we can start building apps that use our body movements and gestures to control our screen, opening doors to innovative, touchless applications.
